# The Managerial Process for Equity Funds

The managerial process is the *day-by-day* activity of the *managers* managing the investment made by the *investors*.
When highlighting the characteristics of the managerial process, 
both academia and practitioners consider this process as made up of four steps:
- 1. Fundraising - 1.5y in EU vs 1y in US
- 2. Investment activity - evaluation & managment
- 3. Managing and Monitoring - ensure the creation of *value*
- 4. Exiting - most important by *generating a capital gain*

>The exiting moment is in the end the reason **why managers do PE activities**, 
that is they have to understand **when** (and **if**) they will be able to exit.

# Fundraising

Fundraising is a selling game about the business idea in which *reputation*, mutual trust, and love for risk are the pillars.
The proposal is basically a business idea that leads to the creation of a vehicle to invest in private equity to produce value that will be spread among the promoters- managers and the investors.

The typical fundraising activity steps are as follows:
- 1.  Business Idea Creation 
- 2.  Job Selling
- 3.  Raising Debt
- 4.  Closing

## Business Idea Creation

The information memorandum has to explain the rationale of the *business idea* which is strictly linked to 
the *reputation* and to the track record of the promoter to the business community

Internal code of activity in EU vs LPA's contract in US

## Job Selling

The *letter of commitment* via one-to-one meetings between the promoters and the potential counterparts

## Debt Raising

Only accurs in the US and in the UK 

The goal is to sell a project to a community of financers and it is difficult for each counterpart (the investors and the banks)
to make the first move. Still the reputation is important.

## Closing

A "successful" closing occurs based on it reputation and the purpose of the initiative or a "pure" closing without any money collection.
