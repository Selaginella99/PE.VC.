- Who can be a PEI
- How an investor works
- How the regulation works for PE
- The remuneration of PE

# Overview
## The Formats
1. The European Union format: This format is regulated by a Directive of the European Union.
 - two Directives regulating PE activity: The Banking Directive & The Financial Services Directive
2. The Anglo-Saxon format: This format is regulated by US and UK laws.
 - In the Anglo-Saxon world, PE is not a financial service (as it is in Europe), rather it is an entrepreneurial activity.

# The European Union world
##  Three vehicles can be a PEI in Europe
1. Closed-End Funds - most suitable player
 - Asset Management Company (AMC)
 - Closed-End Fund
 - Investors
2. Banks  
3. Investment Firms

Notes: Closed end funds have a fixed maturity and a fixed amount of money to invest.

## Rules
For the AMC, the set of **rules** concerns:
1. Minimum requirements to operate 
2. Governance rules
3. Management rules

## Lifetime of a Closed-End Fund in Europe

Fundraising - Draw Down Period - Getting to Time N - Extra Time

1.  Year 0-3: first investment
2.  Year 3-5: exit from the first investment
3.  Year 5-7: second investment
4.  Year 7-10: exit from the second investment

## Management Fees and Carried Interest

### Management Fees
- The management fees is a *fixed* percentage of money 
calculated on the value of the closed-end fund in the beginning of the fund itself.

### Carried Interest
- Maximizing the carried interest is the ultimate goal and desire of an AMC.
- CARRIED INTEREST = % x (Final IRR â€“ Hurdle IRR)
- The fixed percentage - 25-30%; the hurdle rate - 7-8%

## Investment Firms and Banks in Europe

### Banks
Banks have to follow very strict constraints and rules.

### Investment firms

- A-shareholders: act as an AMC. management fees + a yearly carried interest
- B-shareholders: profits - the carried interest given to A-shareholders

Investment firms can undertake the same activity as banks with the exception of collecting money through deposits.

# The Anglo-Saxon World
A fund is just simply a common pool, that means a bank account in which investors put money to be managed all together.

limited partnership (LP): An LP is one of the typical structures to create a company in the US, whereas common organizational forms are: sole proprietorship, partnership, limited-liability partnership, limited partnership, S-corporation and C-corporation.
That means PE investment is considered a business activity and not a financial activity as it is in Europe.

A trust is a very old British institution (there is evidence of the first trusts in the 11th and 12th century) and 
it is an entity, not a company. The trust was born in the first place for succession issues, as a matter of fact through this mechanism the owner (called the settlor) does not have to manage the assets, for a third player will do it (the trustee) and that is fully liable. 
In case the VCT has a maturity, at the end of the VCT the owner gets back the assets belonging to the trust.
