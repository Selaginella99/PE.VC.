# What Is Private Equity and Venture Capital?

## Preliminary Definitions

Two aspects of the definitions:
- PE is **a source of financing**: It is an alternative to other sources of liquidity, (such as a loan or an initial public offering (IPO)) for the company receiving the financing.
- PE is **an investment** made by a financial institution: Private Equity Investor (PEI) in the equity of a non-listed company (i.e. not a public company).

Venture Capital is a very specific case of PE. It is the investment in the **very early stages** of a company’s life.
