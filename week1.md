# What is Private Equity and Venture Capital?

## Preliminary Definitions

Two aspects of the Private Equidity (PE):
- PE is **a source of financing**: It is an alternative to other sources of liquidity, (such as a loan or an initial public offering (IPO)) for the company receiving the financing.
- PE is **an investment** made by a financial institution: Private Equity Investor (PEI) in the equity of a non-listed company (i.e. not a public company).

Venture Capital (VC) is a very specific case of PE. It is the investment in the **very early stages** of a company’s life.

## The relationship between the PEI and the VBC

The investor gets shares of the equity of the company in return for the inflow of cash.

## The Consequences the Financing
- A certain and clearly identified reason;
- The issuance of equity on the private market,
- The newly issued shares will be bought by the PEI;
- The investor: a shareholder + the managers of the company
- Create profit only through the generation of *capital gain* 

> The most critical aspect in PE is the **strict relationship** between the investor and the entrepreneur.

# Why Companies Need PE And VC

PE is based on two aspects:
- A source of financing
- An investment

The venture-backed company wants to enjoy some direct and indirect benefits:
- 1. Certification Benefit 
- 2. Network Benefit
- 3. Knowledge Benefit 
- 4. Financial Benefit

## 1. Certification Benefit 
This can give a sign of great health of the company and this high quality can be used as a kind of promotion for the venture-backed company’s brand.

## 2. Network Benefit
The PEI can give the company a very *strong network*, in terms of suppliers, customers and banks therefore multiplying its possible contacts.

## 3. Knowledge Benefit 
- Soft Knowledge: the capability to manage the business
- Hard Knowledge: the specific-field knowledge of a business "high-tech or pharmaceutical industries"

An advisor and mentor

## 4. Financial Benefit

Equity ⬆️  →→ Rating ⬆️  →→ Positive effect on the cost of capital
